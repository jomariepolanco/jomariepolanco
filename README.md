##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jo!

I'm a full stack software developer with over 4 years of sales and recruitment experience. Aka, I like connecting the dots and creating optimal solutions. I'm a pretty active person, so if I'm not coding, I'm out hiking, running, rowing, or overall just enjoying as much time outside as I can.
